This is because given two points along the straight line, we can divide the change in $y$ over those two points by the change in $x$ over those two points, and that is the value of our slope.  Then once we have the value for our slope variable, we can take a point along the line and know that our formula satisfy that the $x$ value at that point multiplied by our calculated slope, plus some number $b$ should equal the $y$ value at that point.
